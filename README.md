🏵️ Iris Flower Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its sepal and petal dimensions. The model is built using supervised learning techniques and deployed with a simple, modern web interface.
________________________________________
📋 Description
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using four key features — Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, widely used for pattern recognition and classification tasks.
The project includes:
•	Data preprocessing and visualization for better understanding of relationships between features.
•	Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or SVM.
•	Evaluation of model accuracy and performance metrics.
•	A Flask-based web app for interactive prediction, where users can input values and get real-time predictions.
•	Clean and responsive UI/UX design with modern styling.
